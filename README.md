# SNF_ADHDsubtypes_project

This project will be conducted for BrainHack school 2020

##Background

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders among children and adolescents. Subtype classification of ADHD has not reach consensus whithin the litterature and research on the correlates of ADHD subtypes show incoherent findings.Those subtypes are for the majority based on criteria derived from behavioral and-self-report data and lack of neurophysiological assessment is prominent((Hegerl et al. 2016)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27178310/]; (Olbrich, Dinteren & Arns, 2015)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26901357/]).

##Project definition

This project will aim to investigate the presence of subtypes of ADHD from the possible associations between different types of measurements, pairing common behavioral and self-reporting measures to electrophysiological (EEG) data, as well as exploring complementary attributes. To do so, a Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) will be used to integrate these different types of data in a non-linear fashion, guided by the tutorial from Ross Markello. SNF permits the construction of networks of samples (here of ADHD participants) for each data type, that will then all be aggregated into in one novel network ((Wang et al., 2014)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24464287/]). Integrating data with this method allows the exploration of common and complementary information between these different types of data.

##Data

The sample consisted of 101 college students with an ADHD condition. Different types of measurements are included in this data sample. EEG data recording was performed using a 19-channel electrode cap (international 10-20 system) and consisted of eyes-opened at-rest recording of 5-minute duration. Time-frequency analyses were conducted for each electrode in order to extract amplitude means for each frequency band. Neuropsychological assessment measures included were Conners questionnaire (self-report) and IVA-II behavioral test.

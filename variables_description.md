Conners questionnaire : 
standardized questionnaire. Comprizes 66 items about ADHD symptoms and behaviors.
Answers are given using a Likert scale (0 = not at all/never and 3 = very often/very frequent). The items
are compiled into 4 scales; 
- inattention/memory (IM)
- hyperactivity/agitation (HA)
- impulsivity/emotional lability (IL)
- problems with self concept (PE) (refers to self esteem)
These four scores are used as the 4 self report symptoms measures. Test-retest correlation for 18-29 
years old ranges from 0,8 to 0,92 depending on items.

IVA-II : 
Behavioral test. Participants are presented with visual and auditive stimuli (numbers). If the 
stimulus is 1, whether it is visual or auditive, subjects must click as quickly as possible. If the stimulus
is 2, whether it is visual or auditive, subjects must refrain from clickling. Stimuli are presented
in a randomized order and at random time. 2 main scales are extracted, comprising 2 subscales each. 1st 
main scale is Attention Quotient (AQ) and its subscales are AQ auditive and AQ visual. 2nd main scale is
Response Control Quotient (RCQ) and its subscales are RCQ auditive and RCQ visual. 

Electroencephalography : 
19 electrodes caps were used, positioned according to the 10-20 international 
system and referenced to both ear lobes. Recordings lasted 5 minutes, were participants were instructed
to be as still as possible and to keep their eyes opened. The Mitsar System 201 and WinEEG (Mitast) softwares
were used for recording. Test-retest and split-half correlations were higher than 0,9.
